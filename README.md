ðŸŒ¿ Greenden Website Recreation â€“ Built with Tailwind CSS

I'm excited to share my latest frontend project â€” a full recreation of the Greenden website using Tailwind CSS. This was more than just a UI rebuild â€” it was an exercise in precision, responsiveness, and crafting clean, scalable code with a utility-first approach.

ðŸ’» Project Overview:
This project was inspired by the original Greenden design, known for its calm aesthetic and minimal, nature-themed layout. My goal was to recreate it from scratch, with a focus on:

Responsive Design: Optimized for all screen sizes â€” mobile, tablet, and desktop

Pixel-Perfect Layout: Matched the original UI as closely as possible

Tailwind Mastery: Leveraged Tailwindâ€™s utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness

Performance Focused: Lightweight, fast-loading, and accessible

ðŸ§  What I Learned:

How to structure and scale projects using Tailwindâ€™s utility-first methodology

The importance of design consistency and responsive UI/UX practices

Reinforced best practices for component-based HTML structure and clean code organization

Strengthened my eye for detail and appreciation for small UI touches

ðŸ›  Tools & Tech Used:

HTML5

Tailwind CSS

Git & GitHub (version control)

ðŸŒ± Why It Matters:
Every project like this improves not only my technical abilities, but also my design thinking and attention to user experience. Iâ€™m excited to keep building and pushing my frontend skills forward!
